# Fabric-RTI-Demo
How to create a [Real Time Intelligence](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/overview) demo with Fabric.

# Context
Real Time intelligence can be used to ingest, process, monitor events from multiple sources such as Plants and Machineries.
The idea is to simulate a set of plants each with multiple machineries 
Each Machinery from all the plants will emit their own KPIs and Errors (if needed). 
In this example an event will represent either a set of Kpis from a machinery or an Error thrown by a machinery.
All the event use Json format.

# How to simulate Kpi and Error
Plants, Machineries, KPIs and Errors can be simulated by using this [PlantSimulator](https://github.com/lucaferrari77/PlantSimulator).
